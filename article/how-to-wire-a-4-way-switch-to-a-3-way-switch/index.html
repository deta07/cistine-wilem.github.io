It doesn�t matter which traveler wire goes on which bottom screw. When you make use of your finger or the actual circuit along with your eyes, it is easy to mistrace the circuit. Compare the l1 wire in this method with the l1 wire in s4 method 2 above.

Source: pinterest.com</p><p>A 4 way switch must be wired between two 3 way switches as shown in the diagrams on this page. It can get crowded with so many wires in the ceiling box so you must use a larger size electrical box to be code compliant. All you need to do is find the 4 wire that currently runs from one of your 3 way switches to the other. The first switch energizes either the black or red wire traveling to the other switch, the second switch receives the energy through either the black wire ot the red wire. In the case of 3 way switching, you can connect the live wire with both the switches separately (which is also known as ‘alternate 3 way switching’), but you can connect the live wire with the intermediate switch in the case of 4 way switching.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/4e/43/39/4e433939e20cc89014510af9fa49eba7.jpg alt="Alternate 4-way Switch Wiring Diagram Light Switch Wiring 4 Way Light Switch 3 Way Switch Wiring" title="Alternate 4-way Switch Wiring Diagram Light Switch Wiring 4 Way Light Switch 3 Way Switch Wiring" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
