Once you’ve done this, remove all hoses from their fittings in order to drain the plumbing.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ed/a6/60/eda66087edb11e6dd88912960645c006.jpg alt="How To Get Your Hot Tub Ready For Winter Use Hot Tub Outdoor Design Hot Springs" title="How To Get Your Hot Tub Ready For Winter Use Hot Tub Outdoor Design Hot Springs" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Just look in on it once a week or so. When it’s time to replace the water, we recommend using vanishing act® calcium remover in areas with high calcium hardness (commonly known as “hard water”).
