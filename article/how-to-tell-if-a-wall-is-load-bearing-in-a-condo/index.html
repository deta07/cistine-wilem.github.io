Notice how the joists above the wall run perpendicular to the wall itself. Generally, if a wall is load bearing, these joists will be perpendicular to the wall. This is not always the case, but is a good starting point.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/600x315/61/29/18/61291841f07b26556a2070ef47f82cf9.jpg alt="Pin On 17002 - Brick" title="Pin On 17002 - Brick" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Yes that is for sure [the wall is load bearing]. The span of those joists over to the main beam is to long to be supported by the size of joists indicated with out some support along the way. Go upstairs and see if the wall continues from below.

Three things tell me that: Another good way to tell in old construction is to look and see if the ceiling joists are sistered above the wall (if they are running perpendicular), if they are it is definitely a bearing wall.

Simply look up and see if you can spot beams or joists that run the length of the ceiling. Generally, if a wall is load bearing, these joists will be perpendicular to the wall. This was commonly done to save on the cost of longer lumber.
