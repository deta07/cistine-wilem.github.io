Subtract y on both sides of the equation:</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/564x/3e/fc/c0/3efcc01a148e58230cc8822af9d81351.jpg alt="Writing The Equation Of A Line Worksheet Writing Equations Point Slope Form Writing" title="Writing The Equation Of A Line Worksheet Writing Equations Point Slope Form Writing" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

To find equation of the line passing through points $a(x_a, y_a)$ and $b(x_b, y_b)$ ( $ x_a \ne x_b $), we use formula: Standard form is useful for solving systems of equations and for determining intercepts. Standard form is ax + by = c but you are only given 2 points so you cannot write 3 equations to solve for, a, b, and c.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/67/e8/ee/67e8ee033c9e491f7018431d29ea8ee2.jpg alt="Standard Form Slope And Y Intercept 8 Facts You Never Knew About Standard Form Slope And Y I Slope Intercept Form Slope Intercept Standard Form" title="Standard Form Slope And Y Intercept 8 Facts You Never Knew About Standard Form Slope And Y I Slope Intercept Form Slope Intercept Standard Form" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
