When adding transmission fluid to your charger, be sure to add it slowly as it will fill up quickly and is difficult to remove excess fluid if. A dodge charger will cost about $7,809 for maintenance and repairs during its first 10 years of service. Add or remove oil as necessary and recheck the oil level. Generally i will fill it with 3.5 quarts and then drive her around until it gets hot and keep filling to 65.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://d2n97g4vasjwsk.cloudfront.net/2013+Dodge+Charger+SE+3.6L+V6+FlexFuel%2FTransmission+Fluid+-+Part+3.png alt="Add Transmission Fluid 2011-2014 Dodge Charger Se 36l V6 Flexfuel" title="Add Transmission Fluid 2011-2014 Dodge Charger Se 36l V6 Flexfuel" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
