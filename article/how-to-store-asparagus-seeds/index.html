Asparagus growing in sandy soil should be watered more than once per week in the absence of rain, and heavy clay soils may not need to be watered as often. Transplant each plant in a hole 10cm (4) deep and gradually cover the crown with soil as it grows. Draw soil over crowns with a hoe to form a ridge. Although asparagus can tolerate some shade, full sun is preferential as it produces more vigorous plants, and helps to minimise disease. If you need to store the crowns longer than a week, you have a few options depending on space and timeline.</p><h3 id=use-a-sharp-knife-cutting-the-spears-25cm-below-the-level-of-the-soil>Use a sharp knife, cutting the spears 2.5cm below the level of the soil.</h3><p>If you got a shipment of asparagus crowns in the mail but you aren’t ready to plant them right away, open up the box so the crowns can breathe and keep them in a cool, dark place for up to a week. Harvest by bending spears over until they snap, or cut just below soil surface. Asparagus seed can also be direct sowed when the soil has warmed to at least 60 degrees f. Raised beds or behind retaining walls will provide the drainage and soil warmth that asparagus crave. If they have not received an inch of rain in the last week, soak the soil with water. Asparagus fern seeds can be started any time of year, so they can be pretreated and sown immediately or stored in an airtight jar inside the refrigerator for later sowing.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/93/ff/af/93ffafa49e7a32e84174b415ded334b9.jpg alt="How To Store Asparagus Keep It Fresher For Longer How To Store Asparagus Asparagus How To Cook Asparagus" title="How To Store Asparagus Keep It Fresher For Longer How To Store Asparagus Asparagus How To Cook Asparagus" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
