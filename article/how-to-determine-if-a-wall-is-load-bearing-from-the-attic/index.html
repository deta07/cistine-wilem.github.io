They typically are carrying and transferring a load from one point to another.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/474x/e5/32/a8/e532a86905ba5824cd1d0867e56123c6--roof-trusses-roof-repair.jpg alt="Bracing Roof Trusses From The Interior Will Reinforce The Entire Roof Sturcture Roof Truss Design Roof Trusses House Roof" title="Bracing Roof Trusses From The Interior Will Reinforce The Entire Roof Sturcture Roof Truss Design Roof Trusses House Roof" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

And the best way to locate the structural walls in your building is to refer to the blueprints.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/e2/96/43/e2964321a43a55d8575bfe040d478be5--how-to-know-if-a-wall-is-load-bearing-removing-a-load-bearing-wall.jpg alt="Pin On Handyman Tools" title="Pin On Handyman Tools" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
