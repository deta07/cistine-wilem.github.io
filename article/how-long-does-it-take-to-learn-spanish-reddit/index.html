Reduce your spanish time to one hour a day and, according to fsi, it will take about 1.5 years to learn. Going off my own personal experience, i reckon it took about that time, 600 hours. If we are able to put in 10 hours a day to learn a language, then basic fluency in the easy languages should take 48 days, and for difficult languages 72 days. Provided many of those hours included speaking with a native speaker and you’d be able to have conversations with just about anyone about most topics that interest you.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e2/f8/33/e2f833b20e3e2220c3115307b473472b.png alt="Spanish Adverbs Homeschool Spanish Learning Spanish Grammar And Vocabulary" title="Spanish Adverbs Homeschool Spanish Learning Spanish Grammar And Vocabulary" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Maybe less though and to be honest, many of those hours didn�t feel like work. If you�re like most people, however, and you have other life commitments, it will take much longer. It comes short in giving an exact answer to how long language learning takes, because, well, there isn’t one. There are people that don�t know a lick of spanish (or any other romance language) who get themselves to b2 in six months.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cf/d2/7f/cfd27f656c9115193aef74a1dc26385d.jpg alt="Pin On Teaching" title="Pin On Teaching" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
