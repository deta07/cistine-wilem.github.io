The square root of 5 is approximately 2.236068, so the golden ratio is approximately 0.5 + 2.236068/2 = 1.618034.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/474x/d4/4b/28/d44b284ca2bb46f172813062186a1ce7--drawing-tutorials-art-tutorials.jpg alt="Golden Ratio Golden Ratio Golden Ratio In Design Fibonacci" title="Golden Ratio Golden Ratio Golden Ratio In Design Fibonacci" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

We take the width of 1000 pixels and divide it by 1.618 to get a height of about 618 pixels. Of course, the mathematical equation at work is much more complicated than that, but this is the base for the creation.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do submittion their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site convienient, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how to make golden ratio by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
