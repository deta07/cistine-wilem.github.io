Take the resulting figure and place it over the common denominator.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/aa/85/35/aa8535fa7201a81baa7b1657952df179.jpg alt="Addsubtract Fractions With Unlike Denominators Smiley-fa Fractions Subtracting Fractions Teaching Math" title="Addsubtract Fractions With Unlike Denominators Smiley-fa Fractions Subtracting Fractions Teaching Math" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
