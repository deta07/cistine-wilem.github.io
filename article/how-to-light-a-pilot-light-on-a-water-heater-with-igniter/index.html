The general technique of lighting a pilot light involves looking for a knob with temperature settings and a notch that says, “pilot” or “pilot light” on the access panel. Let’s start by explaining the water heater pilot light so you can better understand how it functions. The water heater pilot light is a small flame that ignites the gas burner on your water heater. The spark is small, and the igniter is deep inside the base of the water heater.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7f/6c/05/7f6c0576b4dead22b0005fbd78e9af83.jpg alt="Dometic Atwood Gc10a-4e Rv Propane Electric Hot Water Heater - 10 Gal Water Heater Hot Water Heater Heater" title="Dometic Atwood Gc10a-4e Rv Propane Electric Hot Water Heater - 10 Gal Water Heater Hot Water Heater Heater" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
