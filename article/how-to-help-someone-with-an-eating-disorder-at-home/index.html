Getting professional help from a doctor, practice nurse, or a school or college nurse will give your friend or relative the best chance of getting better. It can help you address thoughts, feelings and behaviors related to your eating disorder, learn skills to manage symptoms, and regain healthy eating patterns.

Source: pinterest.com</p><p>Remember that seeing acts of ordinariness like eating meals, having snacks and relaxing can help a person with an eating disorder to see the possibility of a life away from the struggles they are currently living with. But this can be one of the most difficult steps for someone living with an eating disorder, so try to encourage them to seek help or offer to go along with them. Help create an atmosphere of acceptance and appreciation for different body types and sizes in your peer group. After studying on how eating disorders occur and affect life, you will have more compassion and empathy for that person.
