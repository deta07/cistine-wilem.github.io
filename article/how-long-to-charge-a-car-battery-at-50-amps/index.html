Therefore, it is always suggested to charge 12 volts battery at 10 amps. If using a low amp charger it can take up to 24 hours to charge your battery properly but a high amperage charger such as a 40 amp charger will get the job done adequately in an hour or less and will get you on. Our online calculator will help to calculate how much time needs for charging a car battery, using a direct current. But then, as the battery builds up resistance, the amps begin to taper off, and taper off more quickly as the battery becomes increasingly charged.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/24/50/1f/24501fd180e3bdbdc1b5d8674e9c67e9.jpg alt="Pin On Batteries" title="Pin On Batteries" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
