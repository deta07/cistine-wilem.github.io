Once you know the psi range, use your tire gauge by placing it on the valve and pressing down, causing the needle on the gauge to move and display the pressure. If your tires take 33 psi for example, you will put air in your tires with an air compressor for a while, then check the pressure with the gauge if you have put in too much you can let out air by halfway inserting the gauge. Write down the reading for the tyre.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/32/21/63/322163bfeced474ae1c31ed3b0e8e4a6.jpg alt="Pin On The More You Know" title="Pin On The More You Know" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The fact that you don’t have a pressure gauge should not make you ignore checking on the pressure. Use this protrusion to depress the small pin with a round head that’s inside the valve stem on the wheel. Make sure you have your manufacturer�s psi handy when you�re checking your tire pressure, and then follow these steps: Always keep your gauge at room temperature settings as both high and low temperatures can impact the performance.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/91/2e/08/912e08b3e96be52cc1ab2307f23aeaa6.gif alt="How To Check Tire Pressure Car Maintenance Pressure Tire" title="How To Check Tire Pressure Car Maintenance Pressure Tire" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
