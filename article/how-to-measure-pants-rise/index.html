Half hips and half hips front may measure the same on pants by some makers. Unlike low rise pants, which are meant to be worn at the hip, short rise pants are meant to be worn at the natural waist. The pant rise is important because it determines where your pants sit on your body, which in turn creates your perceived waistline. Measure across the bottom of the pant hem, from one edge of the leg opening to the other.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/b3/93/bd/b393bd93d58c8337e840b11c894b5d17.jpg alt="Pin On Clothing Size Style Charts" title="Pin On Clothing Size Style Charts" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
