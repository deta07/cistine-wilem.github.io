In california, regulations require a body to be embalmed or refrigerated if final disposition will not occur within 24 hours. A funeral is typically held around one or two weeks after the death, though it may be longer if the funeral director only has certain days available or if there is an inquest into the death. However, embalming may be recommended to preserve a body between the time of death and time of visitation, burial, cremation or alkaline hydrolysis. The combination of the alkaline solution, pressure and heat speeds up what could take more than two decades to occur naturally after.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src="https://i.insider.com/555f609a6bb3f7ef3272d40b?width=1000&amp;amp;format=jpeg&amp;amp;auto=webp" alt="Why We Now Cremate Half Of Our Dead In The Us" title="Why We Now Cremate Half Of Our Dead In The Us" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
