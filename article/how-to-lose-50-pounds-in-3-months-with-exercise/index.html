If you were to increase your duration to 60 minutes, you would burn 590 calories.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/600x315/1f/01/c3/1f01c35107247427c45263402f4136df.jpg alt="Pin On Fit Body" title="Pin On Fit Body" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
