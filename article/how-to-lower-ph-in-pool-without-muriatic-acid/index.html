That will stop the muriatic acid from falling to the bottom surface and damaging it. The second and most essential step in properly adding muriatic acid in pool water is diluting the acid. Muriatic acid, diluted sulfuric acid, or the crystalline sodium acid salt of sulfuric acid (sodium bisulfate) all are used to lower pool ph levels;my ph was too low and and i was adding a little ph up powder when a large chunk plopped into the pool.no, although sulfuric acid can be used to lower ph, it’s less commonly used as it has a high.
