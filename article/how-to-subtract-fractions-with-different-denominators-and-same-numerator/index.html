(c) now simply subtract the numerator and retain the same denominator.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/474x/85/aa/96/85aa967fa74f4c2c9976d15f577310e5--math-strategies-math-resources.jpg alt="Adding Fractions With Unlike Denominators Fractions Fractions Worksheets Adding Fractions" title="Adding Fractions With Unlike Denominators Fractions Fractions Worksheets Adding Fractions" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The steps we follow to subtract fractions with variables are as follows: Then, subtract the fractions and simplify. 1) the denominators of the fractions must be the same, and 2) the adding and subtracting is done with only the numerators of the fractions.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/474x/5b/da/ca/5bdacae9aaca6627e5f9fc76e5c767ce.jpg alt="Pin On Addicted To Teaching" title="Pin On Addicted To Teaching" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
