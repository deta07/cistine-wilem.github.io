The first step to multiplying fractions is to line them up so that their numerators and denominators are next to each other. With the multiplication of fractions you multiply the numerators and the denominators with each other, for example: 4 + 2 + 1 x 3 − 1 2x = 4 + (2 + 1 x) × 2x (3 − 1 2x) × 2x. Suppose 2ab 2 / ab is a fraction with variables in the numerator and denominator.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/39/43/1a/39431ad426dabe9c9557be0d42a42d75.png alt="Pin By Rebecca Shaver On School-math Fractions Worksheets Math Fractions Worksheets Studying Math" title="Pin By Rebecca Shaver On School-math Fractions Worksheets Math Fractions Worksheets Studying Math" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
