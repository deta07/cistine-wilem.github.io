You do not get to look at your cards at this point in the game. All cards are face value (royalty is 10) <em>except</em> the king which is 0 points. Play continues clockwise until a player has all his/her cards facing up.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6d/ba/54/6dba54f09ee482d5d8edc8262b5542f3.png alt="How To Play Golf Card Game Fun Card Games Card Games For Kids Family Card Games" title="How To Play Golf Card Game Fun Card Games Card Games For Kids Family Card Games" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The dealer will hand each player 4 cards, one card at a time. If you have more players, you will need an additional deck.
