Solder the connecting wire onto the solder points that are on both ends of the led strip lights. First, you have to make sure that you tin both wires and copper dots on the led strip lights. For best results, clean the contacts with fine sandpaper or.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/27/66/a3/2766a32aa62e7e963c407e28dd263ff3.jpg alt="How To Connect An Led Strip To A Power Supply Led Lighting Diy Led Strip Lighting Installing Led Strip Lights" title="How To Connect An Led Strip To A Power Supply Led Lighting Diy Led Strip Lighting Installing Led Strip Lights" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Using helping hands or a vice, mount the wire and the strip so that it takes minimal or no effort to get the wire and the hard point to touch. You may use your fingernail (if you use a knife be very careful not to cut through the circuit board). The led strip lights are now connected, and power should flow through the entire length of the strip.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/474x/2f/af/66/2faf66016927486c705f0a89779ef3bf.jpg alt="Pin On Wine Cellar Basement Diy" title="Pin On Wine Cellar Basement Diy" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Individually place the wire to the copper dots and then place the soldering iron over both in order to heat up each solder enough to melt and become one. Keep from damaging the led chips with to much heat. You may use your fingernail (if you use a knife be very careful not to cut through the circuit board). Connect the tinned rgb wires to the copper dots of your strip lights.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do sharing their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site adventageous, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how to solder wires to led strip by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
