To read a digital electric meter, read the series of large numbers near the center of your meter and write them down. If playback doesn�t begin shortly, try restarting your device. At least i get to practice being shocked before my bill arrives.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://images.metronewscentral.net/NHrHTkD8yAmeralco-meter.jpg alt="Meralco Announces Lower January Electricity Rates" title="Meralco Announces Lower January Electricity Rates" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
