The fact that you are not wanting to speed drying up, or confuse drying with curing, the process of becoming stronger or harder is explained well already. Most mixes are cured at 28 days. Concrete applications may be considered hot weather concrete at temperatures ranging from 77 to 95 degrees fahrenheit depending on the specific application. But to answer the question of, “how long does concrete take to set?” concrete setting time is generally 24 to 48 hours. As a chemical process, it is highly dependent on a number of variables, including composition of the mix and, especially, temperature.</p><h3 id=slow-curing-means-brittle-concrete-thatll-never-set-properly>Slow curing means brittle concrete that’ll never set properly.</h3><p>If the temperature of the mix environment.
