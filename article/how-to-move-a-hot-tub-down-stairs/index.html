Lift the hot tub onto the 4 by 4 timber, slide the dollies underneath before strapping the hot tub securely and wheeling it up the ramp. When you get to your destination and you are ready to move the tub again, you should start by slowly and gently lowering the tub to the ground so as not to break it.
