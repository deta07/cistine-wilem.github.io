Source: pinterest.com</p><p>In this video i show you how to change a generation 3 mazda (2016 mazda 3) transmission fluid. The transmission fluid change lets your mechanic get a close look at the transmission pan and the filter. Then you can undo the drain plug and drain out the fluid. Your mechanic drains the transmission fluid, replaces the filter, then refills the transmission with fresh, new fluid. As i said above, you’ll need a little more than 3 quarts.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/474x/c1/1e/87/c11e87bf3e1ffbe0f72c5adea08245c2--automobile-driving-conditions.jpg alt="How To Make My 53 Faster Car Water Pump Car Starter Marvel Mystery Oil" title="How To Make My 53 Faster Car Water Pump Car Starter Marvel Mystery Oil" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

If the transmission fluid level in your 3 is low, you need to add transmission fluid through the dipstick tube. If the transmission fluid does need to be changed on your mazda, the time it takes will depend on how old the vehicle is and how complicated it is to change the fluid. Mazda has been developed sophisticated transmissions through years and it is critical that you add the exact type of transmission fluid stipulated by your owner�s manual (typically in the back of the manual in a section titled fluid capacities.) when adding transmission fluid to your 3, be sure to add it slowly as the transmission fluid.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/564x/93/7e/51/937e5174fb4cf1c989d593a1e19b4933--mazda-mx--mazda-miata.jpg alt="Changing Transmission Fluid Manual Transmission Mx5 2006 Owners Manuals" title="Changing Transmission Fluid Manual Transmission Mx5 2006 Owners Manuals" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

As the engine feeds old fluid into the machine, it fills a diaphram that forces the same amount of new fluid into the return line. Find out how much engine oil does your car need.
