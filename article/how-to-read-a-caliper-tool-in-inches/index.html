Reading the caliper scale at 7 and the round dial at 56 means that the object is 756/1000 inches in width or diameter. If you noticed, the handle of the caliper has a scale that starts from zero on the left and goes up to 6 inches on the right, in this case. Figure 98.2 presentation of 2 arm caliper log data. Basically, the thumb rule in reading vernier caliper is similar both for the inch and mm scale.

You read the whole “inch” amount on the main scale, the whole tenth (.01) amount on the main scale, and then determine the thousandths portion of the measurement on the dial. For example, if a part is measured 1.531, the bar would read 1.5 and the dial would read.031. The main scale contributes to the main number and one decimal place. Other calipers can be much longer in length.

Will measure slightly more than 6 inches. You read the whole “inch” amount on the main scale, the whole tenth (.01) amount on the main scale, and then determine the thousandths portion of the measurement on the dial. The design of the tool permits measurements to made over a large range of sizes. If you noticed, the handle of the caliper has a scale that starts from zero on the left and goes up to 6 inches on the right, in this case.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c7/80/b3/c780b366859a7341782a7ea732ee266c.jpg alt="Vernier Caliper Vernier Caliper Vernier Mechanical Engineering Technology" title="Vernier Caliper Vernier Caliper Vernier Mechanical Engineering Technology" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://cistine-wilem.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
