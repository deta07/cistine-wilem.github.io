This is done automatically in the script by replacing all occurances of y with y[x]. Dsolve[eqn, u, {x, xmin, xmax}] solves a differential equation for x between xmin and xmax. The type of differential equations i am particularly interested in is $\dfrac{dy}{dx}=f(x,y)$ with initial condition $y(0)=a$.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do submittion their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site adventageous, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how to solve differential equations in mathematica by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
