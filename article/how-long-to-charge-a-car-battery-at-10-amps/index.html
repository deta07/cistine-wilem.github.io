Depending on the age of your battery, the capacity and construction of the charger and the charging technique used, it may take a few hours to reach a complete charge. In our example, if we use a 10 amp charger to replenish the needed 36 amp hours, we could simply divide 36 by 10, which yield a result of 3.6. This means that when charging the example battery with a 10 amp charger, it will take 3.6 hours to fully charge.
